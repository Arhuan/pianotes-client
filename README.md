# pianotes

Oftentimes, when learning to play musical instruments, we find ourselves "memorizing"
the pieces that we are learning by finding patterns that repeat themselves within the musical piece
or drilling the pieces into our muscle memory. Because of this beginners can
find it difficult to learn how to sight-read sheets as it is easy to let your
body go into auto-pilot as you play the same beginner pieces over and over again.

Pianotes is a web application inspired by type-racing applications such as
[TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) and [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/)
to help people learn to sight-read piano (or any other similar instruments!)
musical sheets by randomly generating notes to help build the intuition
and fluidity in the language of musical notes.

This project is split into two repositories:
